# Webxr-Business_Card
 ![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/szbrooks2017/Webxr-Business_Card/main/assets/ar-business-card.png)
  An introduction to the WebXR API. This application uses Three.JS and WebGL to render a business card with animated jellyfish.
 
 ## How to view on Android
 - Go to the following link and click the Start AR button [here](https://szbrooks2017.github.io/Webxr-Business_Card/)
 - Make sure to allow access to your camera when prompted.
 - Launch and explore!

## How to view for IOS
 - Unfortunately the WebXR API isn't compatable with iphones yet!
 - The managing group for Safari is exploring integrating the API.

 ## Intended features
 - Clickable buttons
 - Floating animated jellyfish!! There are four!

## Needs to be implemented
- I want to go back and optimize the meshes/lighting.
- I want to add more interaction with certain objects with animation.
- I want to find a way to integrate this concept with Iphone either with this api or a different framework

## Challenges
- Learning how objects get rendered to a web browser screen.
- Understanding XR UI with raycasting.
- Uploading 3D models for AR
