 ![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/szbrooks2017/Webxr-Business_Card/main/assets/ar-business-card.png)
  An introduction to XR and 3D objects for the Oculus input system. This project is an escape-room-like display, but it's easy to escape.
 
 ## How to install for Android
 - Download the apk from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tZl-6tCvvK0zqAOLl7nTNqpEV0O9dMpc/view?usp=sharing)
 - Sideload the game into your chosen device using [SideQuest](https://sidequestvr.com/).
 - Make sure **Unkown Sources** is enabled in your Oculus app on your computer--in Settings/General.
 - In your Oculus navigate to the 'Unknown Source' in your apps.
 - Launch and explore!

 ## Intended features
 - Teleportation is implemented.
 - Certain objects are interactable.
 - The consoles require the remote to operate in both the storage room and main room.

## Needs to be implemented
- I want to go back and optimize the meshes/lighting.
- I want to add more interaction with certain objects with animation.

## Challenges
- Learning how physics affects everything.
- Understanding XR UI with raycasting.
- Deploying and debugging in VR
